This is a repository for my Sparta Global structured query language (SQL) mini project.

During week two of my training at Sparta Global I learned a few SQL techniques that I implemented to solve SQL queries.

I learnt how to use data manipulation language(DML) which is a syntax used to manipulate data & data definiion language(DDL) which is a syntax used to create and modify database objects.

I learnt how to use the SELECT statment to select data within a given database(Northwind.db) and from there I was able to combine that SELECT statemnt with a FROM statement to select from tables within that database. JOIN statements were also used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
Coupling that syntax with functions like AVG() which returns the average value, COUNT() which returns the number of rows and MAX() which returns the largest value allowed for higher specificity within my searches.

Besides from manipulating data I also learnt how to create a database and populate it with tables and then populate those tables with data in that contain to specific data types.

Overall the SQL week taught me a lot of core concepts and when is best to use them.
